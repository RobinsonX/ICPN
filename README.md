## Introduction

We propose an Interacting Convolution with Pyramid Structure Network (ICPN), which consists of a sufficient aggregation path that focus on more nucleus contexts and a selecting path that enable nucleus localization. The two paths are built on Interacting Convolutional Modules (ICM) and Internal Pyramid Resolution Complementing Modules (IPRCM) respectively. We evaluate our network on public [Herlev dataset(Part II-smear2005.zip)](http://mde-lab.aegean.gr/index.php/downloads).
